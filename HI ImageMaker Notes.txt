Communications Tests:
- Power on w/ DOWN arrow depressed, then release key to capture
  data input in HEX
- Power on w/ UP arrow depressed, then release key to capture
  data input in ASCII characters (not documented in manual)

USB Serial Connection:
  All default settings
    Baud:     9600
    Stop bit: 1
    Parity:   none
  USB/Serial cable works fine (TRENDnet USB serial requires driver to be installed from CD)
    NOTE: pins 2 & 3 must not be switched
          Use null modem DB9F/DB25M cable
  Used C:\Tools\SerialSend.exe for testing
    (from https://batchloaf.wordpress.com/serialsend/)
    SerialSend will find the appropriate USB port
  Echo command from DOS box works fine w/ correct USB port & 9600

USB Parallel Connection:
- USB/Parallel cable shows up in "Devices and Printers" as
  "IEEE-1284 Controller" under "Unspecified" but has no USB port
- 2016-03-20
  Plotter works fine w/ parallel connection from MailBox
  Plotter did work fine w/ USB-to-parallel cable on JukeBox in Feb 2015
  Today JukeBox can't talk to plotter on parallel, but can on serial
  USB/Parallel cable visible in Windows but isn't accessible
- 2016-03-21
  Plotter works fine w/ parallel connection from PhotoBox, JukeBox, ThinkPad
  Procedure used:
  1. Connect cable. An icon will appear in the Devices and Printers window
     under "Unspecified" with the name "IEEE-1284 Controller".
  2. Delete all old USB-Parallel printers created.
  3. Create a new printer (any name will do, but use "USB Parallel Port" for
     clarity.
  4. Choose one of the USB ports listed and print a test page.
  5. If the test page doesn't print, right-click on the new printer and
     choose "Printer Properties" in the context menu.
  6. Delete all USB ports listed (unless USB001 is in use by a known-good
     printer device).  A messagebox will appear indicating that the port
     can't be deleted.  Ignore it.
  7. Select USB ports beginning with USB002 and print test page.  Repeat with
     all available USB ports until the test page begins to print.
  8. If a test page won't print, disconnect the USB cable and re-connect it
     after a few seconds and try again.  For some reason it doesn't always
     work immediately, but eventually it does.
     NOTE: When the printer icon in the "Devices and Printers" window is grayed out,
           the printer isn't ready.  Repeat step 8 until it is no longer grayed out.
  This procedure was effective on all 3 Windows 7 machines.
  It appears that this procedure must be repeated each time the cable is
    removed and reconnected.

  Discovered that sometimes the parallel port will stop working, which
    has happened after sleep/wake, but not with all sleep/wake cycles.
  This was also during development of the C++/C# PlotterWriter solution.
  The symptoms are that output from PlotterWriter doesn't reach the
    plotter, and the spooler shows "Error - Printing" in the document list.
  The solution is to unplug the USB/Parallel cable from the USB slot, wait
    until the device created for it dims in the "Devices and Printers"
    dialog box, then plug it back in.  The device icon should return to its
    non-dimmed/active state, after which it should work fine.  In the event
    that it doesn't, removing and re-creating the printer should fix it.

  NOTE: Once the plotter receives input on a port, it expects input only on
        that port and must powered off and back on to receive input on the
        other port.  The other port may remain connected but any data sent on
        it will be ignored and discarded.
  NOTE: The serial cable used in testing was the DB9/DB25 cable in the
        computer cables drawer in the plastic drawers cabinet, along with
        the RS-232 breakout box used to cross pin 2 from the cable to pin 3
        to the plotter.  Pins 2 & 3 must be turned off on the breakout box.
  NOTE: Pin 2 on the adapter must connect to pin 2 on the plotter, pin 3 to
        pin 3, etc.  "Straight-Through" pin-outs instead of "Null-modem".
  NOTE: Procedure to remove obsolete COM ports:
        1. Open command prompt "Run as administrator"
        2. set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1
        3. start devmgmt.msc
        4. In Device Manager: click View, then Show Hidden Devices.
        5. Expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers"
        6. On each grayed-out node, right-click and select "Uninstall"
        Procedure to change COM Port assignments:
        1. Right-click on the Serial Device you want to change and chose Properties.
        2. In the Properties window, click the Port Settings tab, then "Advanced".
        3. In the window that opens, chose an unused COM Port from the dropdown list.

TODO:
- [x] Test USB serial & parallel cables:
  [x] Parallel device OK w/ disconnecting & reconnecting plotter as long as cable stays connected?
      [x] OK w/ sleep & wake, rebooting, etc.?  Sleep/wake fine
  [x] Serial cable OK w/ disconnecting & reconnecting plotter? yes
      [x] OK w/ sleep & wake, rebooting, etc.? yes
  [ ] Clean up solution
      [ ] Get all projects to build for x86/Win32 in debug & release
      [x] Fix project dependencies so they don't always build w/ each test
  [x] Figure out why changing USB ports causes plotter to show "Alarm" light
  [x] Map out USB numbers for all USB connectors for parallel cable

Note: Plotter doesn't reply to any command while transport is in motion
      Plotter requires 25ms to populate output buffer after receiving command
      Plotter requires 25ms delay before receiving a command that produces a response

Instructions for digitizing:
  If the digitizing begins at the start location, plotting begins from there
  If the digitizing begins anywhere else, the pen is lifted from 0,0 and
    moved to the start location, and plotting begins there.
  Lines are drawn continuously from there without the pen being lifted.
  In order to lift the pen and start plotting from another location,
    press the pen up/down button once at the end of the first plot,
    then move the pen to the desired location of the next start point,
    then press the Enter button.  Plotting will resume from there, and the
    pen will remain down on the paper for continuous plotting until the
    pen up/down button is pressed again.
  To create a series of dots, move the pen to the desired location of each
    dot, and press the pen up/down button once and the Enter button once
    for each dot.  The pen will be lifted after making each dot mark.
  To resume drawing uninterrupted lines, from the last dot, move the pen to
    the desired starting location of the first line and press the Enter
    button.  Then move the pen to each desired corner point and press Enter
    once for each corner as before.
  To end the plot, press the Enter button twice without moving the pen.
  Then the plot will be complete.

  Internally, the plot is saved by ReadDigitizedPoints () as a series of
    groups of 3 int values, and converted to a string of HPGL instructions
    by PlotDigitizedPoints ().  Both may be saved to a file internally by
    adding the code to do so.
